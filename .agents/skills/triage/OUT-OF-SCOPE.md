# Out-of-Scope Knowledge Base

The `.out-of-scope/` directory in a repo stores persistent records of rejected feature requests. It serves two purposes:

1. **Institutional memory** — why a feature was rejected, so the reasoning isn't lost when the issue is closed
2. **Deduplication** — when a new issue comes in that matches a prior rejection, the skill can surface the previous decision instead of re-litigating it

## Directory structure

```
.out-of-scope/
├── dark-mode.md
├── plugin-system.md
└── graphql-api.md
```

One file per **concept**, not per issue. Multiple issues requesting the same thing are grouped under one file.

## File format

The file should be written in a relaxed, readable style — more like a short design document than a database entry. Use paragraphs, code samples, and examples to make the reasoning clear and useful to someone encountering it for the first time.

# Dark Mode

This project does not support dark mode or user-facing theming.

## Why this is out of scope

The rendering pipeline assumes a single color palette defined in
`ThemeConfig`. Supporting multiple themes would require:

- A theme context provider wrapping the entire component tree
- Per-component theme-aware style resolution
- A persistence layer for user theme preferences
